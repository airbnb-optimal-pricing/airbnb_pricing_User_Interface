          <h1>Airbnb Price Navigator</h1>
          <p> 
              Airbnb’s Smart Pricing tool lets you set your prices to automatically go up or down based on changes in demand for listings like yours.
              You’re always responsible for your price, so Smart Pricing is controlled by other pricing settings you choose, and you can adjust nightly prices any time.
              Smart Pricing is based on the type and location of your listing, the season, demand, and other factors (like events in your area).
              Signing up for Airbnb and listing your home is completely free.
              Once you receive a reservation, we charge an Airbnb service fee for hosts, 
              generally 3%, to help cover the cost of running of the business.

              <p>
                  There’s no minimum or mandatory time you have to host, so you can block off dates when you’re not available. 
                  You get to choose your nightly prices, and our pricing tools can help you decide. You can also easily add custom details 
                  To avoid getting booked when you can’t host or have an existing reservation, you can connect your Airbnb calendar with your other calendars. 
                  This allows you to keep all calendars up-to-date automatically.To help set expectations, you can add House Rules that guests must agree to before booking. 
                  If a guest breaks a rule after they book, you can cancel the reservation without penalty.

              <p>
                  You can set whatever price you want for your listing, and charge different rates for weekends or different seasons. But what’s a fair price?
                  One way to find out is to compare your space with other current listings nearby. If you’re just starting out, knock off $20 or more per night until you get some positive reviews under your belt; given the choice, people are going to book a place with good reviews over one without them unless there’s a big savings to be had. 
                  Another way to determine your price is to see what hotels in your area charge. If you can offer an entire apartment for the same price or less than a standard hotel room nearby, you should be able to attract visitors.

            <h2>Pick Your Destination</h2>
            <p>
                Before you begin, you need to consider when — and whether — people travel to your town.
                Do you live in or near a major city? In that case, there’s likely a steady stream of both tourists and business travelers who need a place to stay. Is there a college nearby? You might be able to rent your space for homecoming weekends, college tours, reunions, and graduation. If you live in the mountains or near the ocean, demand for your place may be more seasonal.
